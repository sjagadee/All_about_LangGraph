      "Llama models come in different sizes, ranging from 1 billion to 2 trillion parameters. Initially only a foundation model, starting with Llama 2, Meta AI released instruction fine-tuned versions alongside foundation models.\n",
      "Model weights for the first version of Llama were only available to researchers on a case-by-case basis, under a non-commercial license. Unauthorized copies of the first model were shared via BitTorrent. Subsequent versions of Llama were made accessible outside academia and released under licenses that permitted some commercial use.\n",
      "Alongside the release of Llama 3 and a standalone website, Meta added virtual assistant features to Facebook and WhatsApp in select regions; both services used a Llama 3 model. However, the latest version is Llama 4, released in April 2025.\n",

      "Page: Llama\n",
      "Summary: The llama (; Spanish pronunciation: [ˈʎama] or [ˈʝama]) (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the pre-Columbian era.\n",
      "Llamas are social animals and live with others as a herd. Their wool is soft and contains only a small amount of lanolin. Llamas can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions. When using a pack, they can carry about 25 to 30% of their body weight for 8 to 13 km (5–8 miles). The name llama (also historically spelled \"lama\" or \"glama\") was adopted by European settlers from native Peruvians.\n",
      "The ancestors of llamas are thought to have originated on the Great Plains of North America about 40 million years ago and subsequently migrated to South America about three million years ago during the Great American Interchange. By the end of the last ice age (10,000–12,000 years ago), camelids were extinct in North America. As of 2007, there were over seven million llamas and alpacas in South America. Some were imported to the United States and Canada late in the 20th century; their descendants now number more than 158,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas.\n",
      "In Aymara mythology, llamas are important beings. The Heavenly Llama is said to drink water from the ocean and urinates as it rains. According to Aymara eschatology, llamas will return to the water springs and ponds where they come from at the end of time.\n",

      "Summary: Llama Llama is a children's animated television series that premiered on January 26, 2018, on Netflix. Co-produced by Genius Brands and Telegael Teoranta and based on the books by Anna Dewdney, the series follows an anthropomorphic llama named Llama Llama (voiced by Shayle Simons) living with his Mama Llama (voiced by Jennifer Garner) in a town that is run by anthropomorphic animals where he learns about fun, friendship and new things. The series was produced by Reed Duncan, Dewdney's longtime partner, doing so in tribute to her. The second season was released on November 15, 2019.\n"

       "   'content': 'Iga Swiatek demolished Amanda Anisimova 6-0 6-0 in just 57 minutes - the first time a woman has won a final at Wimbledon without dropping a game since 1911, when Britain’s Dorothea Lambert Chambers triumphed by the same scoreline. “Be proud, Anisimova Amanda, Grand Slam finalist,” he wrote on X. “You’d have to be pretty cold not to feel for Amanda Anisimova,” added tennis commentator Craig Gabriel. “Amanda Anisimova crushed her speech in the most beautiful, serene way, and I’ll never forget it,” wrote tennis journo Chris Oddo. “This has been far more about Swiatek being great than Anisimova being awful,” opined tennis journalist Ben Rothenberg. Swiatek, who now has 100 career Grand Slam match wins, has won the French Open four times and also the US Open, in 2022.',\n",

      "Summary: The economy of India is a developing mixed economy with a notable public sector in strategic sectors. It is the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP); on a per capita income basis, India ranked 136th by GDP (nominal) and 119th by GDP (PPP). From independence in 1947 until 1991, successive governments followed the Soviet model and promoted protectionist economic policies, with extensive Sovietization, state intervention, demand-side economics, natural resources, bureaucrat-driven enterprises and economic regulation. This was a form of the Licence Raj. The end of the Cold War and an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad economic liberalisation in India and indicative planning. India has about 1,900 public sector companies, with the Indian state having complete control and ownership of railways. While the Indian government retains ownership through the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), a large share of new national highway projects are now built and maintained under Public–private partnership (PPP) models rather than being fully government‑funded. The government plays a major role in sectors like Supercomputing, space and shipping but private participation is growing, especially in space, telecom, and satellite communications.\n",
      "Nearly 70% of India's GDP is driven by domestic consumption; the country remains the world's third-largest consumer market. Aside from private consumption, India's GDP is also fueled by government spending, investments, and exports. As of 2025, India is the world's 7th-largest importer and the 10th-largest exporter. India is often described as the ‘pharmacy of the world’, supplying roughly 20% of the global demand for generic medicines and exporting pharmaceuticals to over 200 countries in 2023–24, with around 70% of exports to highly regulated markets like North America and Europe. India has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995. It ranks 40th on the Global Competitiveness Index. As of 2025, India ranks third in the world in total number of billionaires. According to the World Bank, India's Gini index fell to 25.5 in 2022‑23, making it the fourth-most equal country globally, suggesting significant progress in income equality. Economists and social scientists often consider India a welfare state. India's overall social welfare spending stood at 8.6% of GDP in 2021-22. With 607 million workers, the Indian labour force is the world's second-largest. India is among the countries with the longest working hours globally. Although India's labour productivity is lower than advanced economies, it aligns with levels observed in many emerging Asian countries like China.\n",
      "In 2021–22, the foreign direct investment (FDI) in India was $82 billion. The leading sectors for FDI inflows were the Finance, Banking, Insurance and R&D. India has established free trade agreements and economic‑partnership with several countries and regional blocs, including ASEAN, SAFTA, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates, while also concluding agreements with EFTA (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland) and the United Kingdom. India maintains Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreements (CECA/CEPA) with Singapore, Malaysia, Mauritius, and Japan, and continues to negotiate or review \u001b[0m\n",

Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.\n",

Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita, are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n",
      "The rankings of national economies have changed significantly over time.

      "Summary: Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year. Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.\n",
      "Comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita, are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n",
      "The rankings of national economies have changed significantly over time. For instance, the United States overtook the British Empire around 1916; Japan rose rapidly in the post-World War II period to become the world’s second-largest economy by the 1970s; China moved from ninth place in 1978 to second in 2010 following market reforms.

      "Summary: Nominal gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is the total value of a country's finished goods and services (gross domestic product) divided by its total population (per capita).\n",
      "Gross domestic product per capita is often used as a proxy indicator an indicator of a country's standard of living; however, this is inaccurate because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income and does not take into account social and environmental costs and benefits. Measures of personal income include average wage, real income, median income, disposable income and gross national income (GNI) per capita.\n",
      "Comparisons of GDP per capita are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n",
      "GDP per capita does not consider differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results may vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, while the standard of living of its population might not change by as much.\n",
      "Several leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions may be considered tax havens, and their GDP data subject to material distortion by tax-planning activities. Examples include Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland and Luxembourg.\n",
      "Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts (except Kosovo and Taiwan), but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. Four UN members (Cuba, Monaco and North Korea) do not belong to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), hence their economies are not ranked. Kosovo, is not a member of the United Nations and is a member of the IMF. Taiwan is not an IMF member, but it is listed in the official IMF indices.\n",

Figures are based on official exchange rates, not on the purchasing power parity (PPP) methodology.

      "Summary: Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year. Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.\n",
      "Comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita, are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n",
      "The rankings of national economies have changed significantly over time. For instance, the United States overtook the British Empire around 1916; Japan rose rapidly in the post-World War II period to become the world’s second-largest economy by the 1970s; China moved from ninth place in 1978 to second in 2010 following market reforms. These shifts reflect long-term changes in global economic output.\n",
      "The first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank's data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF's definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear in the sources.\n",
