      "Llama models come in different sizes, ranging from 1 billion to 2 trillion parameters. Initially only a foundation model, starting with Llama 2, Meta AI released instruction fine-tuned versions alongside foundation models.\n",
      "Model weights for the first version of Llama were only available to researchers on a case-by-case basis, under a non-commercial license. Unauthorized copies of the first model were shared via BitTorrent. Subsequent versions of Llama were made accessible outside academia and released under licenses that permitted some commercial use.\n",
      "Alongside the release of Llama 3 and a standalone website, Meta added virtual assistant features to Facebook and WhatsApp in select regions; both services used a Llama 3 model. However, the latest version is Llama 4, released in April 2025.\n",

      "Summary: The llama (; Spanish pronunciation: [ˈʎama] or [ˈʝama]) (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the pre-Columbian era.\n",
      "Llamas are social animals and live with others as a herd. Their wool is soft and contains only a small amount of lanolin. Llamas can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions. When using a pack, they can carry about 25 to 30% of their body weight for 8 to 13 km (5–8 miles). The name llama (also historically spelled \"lama\" or \"glama\") was adopted by European settlers from native Peruvians.\n",
      "The ancestors of llamas are thought to have originated on the Great Plains of North America about 40 million years ago and subsequently migrated to South America about three million years ago during the Great American Interchange. By the end of the last ice age (10,000–12,000 years ago), camelids were extinct in North America. As of 2007, there were over seven million llamas and alpacas in South America. Some were imported to the United States and Canada late in the 20th century; their descendants now number more than 158,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas.\n",
      "In Aymara mythology, llamas are important beings. The Heavenly Llama is said to drink water from the ocean and urinates as it rains. According to Aymara eschatology, llamas will return to the water springs and ponds where they come from at the end of time.\n",

Co-produced by Genius Brands and Telegael Teoranta and based on the books by Anna Dewdney, the series follows an anthropomorphic llama named Llama Llama (voiced by Shayle Simons) living with his Mama Llama (voiced by Jennifer Garner) in a town that is run by anthropomorphic animals where he learns about fun, friendship and new things. The series was produced by Reed Duncan, Dewdney's longtime partner, doing so in tribute to her. The second season was released on November 15, 2019.\n",

      "Summary: The economy of India is a developing mixed economy with a notable public sector in strategic sectors. It is the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP); on a per capita income basis, India ranked 136th by GDP (nominal) and 119th by GDP (PPP). From independence in 1947 until 1991, successive governments followed the Soviet model and promoted protectionist economic policies, with extensive Sovietization, state intervention, demand-side economics, natural resources, bureaucrat-driven enterprises and economic regulation. This was a form of the Licence Raj. The end of the Cold War and an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad economic liberalisation in India and indicative planning. India has about 1,900 public sector companies, with the Indian state having complete control and ownership of railways. While the Indian government retains ownership through the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), a large share of new national highway projects are now built and maintained under Public–private partnership (PPP) models rather than being fully government‑funded. The government plays a major role in sectors like Supercomputing, space and shipping but private participation is growing, especially in space, telecom, and satellite communications.\n",
      "Nearly 70% of India's GDP is driven by domestic consumption; the country remains the world's third-largest consumer market. Aside from private consumption, India's GDP is also fueled by government spending, investments, and exports. As of 2025, India is the world's 7th-largest importer and the 10th-largest exporter. India is often described as the ‘pharmacy of the world’, supplying roughly 20% of the global demand for generic medicines and exporting pharmaceuticals to over 200 countries in 2023–24, with around 70% of exports to highly regulated markets like North America and Europe. India has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995. It ranks 40th on the Global Competitiveness Index. As of 2025, India ranks third in the world in total number of billionaires. According to the World Bank, India's Gini index fell to 25.5 in 2022‑23, making it the fourth-most equal country globally, suggesting significant progress in income equality. Economists and social scientists often consider India a welfare state. India's overall social welfare spending stood at 8.6% of GDP in 2021-22.

Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.\n",

On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n",

      "This article includes a list of countries by their forecast estimated GDP (PPP). Countries are sorted by GDP (PPP) forecast estimates from financial and statistical institutions that calculate using market or government official exchange rates. The data given on this page are based on the international dollar, a standardized unit used by economists. Certain regions that are not widely considered countries such as Hong Kong also show up in the list if they are distinct jurisdiction areas or economic entities.  \n",
      "GDP comparisons using PPP are arguably more useful than those using nominal GDP when assessing the domestic market of a state because PPP takes into account the relative cost of local goods, services and inflation rates of the country, rather than using international market exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in per capita income. For example, while the nominal GDP ranks of Germany and India are third and fourth respectively, when adjusted for PPP Germany's GDP drops to sixth and India rises to third because the local cost of goods in India is lower, and thus same nominal amount of money can buy more goods and services in India.\n",
      "GDP adjusted for PPP, however, is limited when measuring financial flows between countries and when comparing the quality of same goods among countries. PPP is often used to gauge global poverty thresholds and is used by the United Nations in constructing the Human Development Index. These surveys such as the International Comparison Program include both tradable and non-tradable goods in an attempt to estimate a representative basket of all goods.\n",

The second table includes data, mostly for the year 2022, for 180 of the 193 current United Nations member states as well as Hong Kong and Macau (the two Chinese Special Administrative Regions). Data are in millions of international dollars; they were compiled by the World Bank. The third table is a tabulation of the CIA World Factbook GDP (PPP) data update of 2019. The data for GDP at purchasing power parity has also been rebased using the new International Comparison Program price surveys and extrapolated to 2007.

According to the World Bank, India's Gini index fell to 25.5 in 2022‑23, making it the fourth-most equal country globally, suggesting significant progress in income equality. Economists and social scientists often consider India a welfare state. India's overall social welfare spending stood at 8.6% of GDP in 2021-22. With 607 million workers, the Indian labour force is the world's second-largest. India is among the countries with the longest working hours globally. Although India's labour productivity is lower than advanced economies, it aligns with levels observed in many emerging Asian countries like China.\n",

India maintains Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreements (CECA/CEPA) with Singapore, Malaysia, Mauritius, and Japan, and continues to negotiate or review trade agreements with partners such as Chile, New Zealand, the European Union, and the Eurasian Economic Union.

It is the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP); on a per capita income basis, India ranked 136th by GDP (nominal) and 119th by GDP (PPP). From independence in 1947 until 1991, successive governments followed the Soviet model and promoted protectionist economic policies, with extensive Sovietization, state intervention, demand-side economics, natural resources, bureaucrat-driven enterprises and economic regulation. This was a form of the Licence Raj. The end of the Cold War and an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad economic liberalisation in India and indicative planning. India has about 1,900 public sector companies, with the Indian state having complete control and ownership of railways. While the Indian government retains ownership through the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), a large share of new national highway projects are now built and maintained under Public–private partnership (PPP) models rather than being fully government‑funded. The government plays a major role in sectors like Supercomputing, space and shipping but private participation is growing, especially in space, telecom, and satellite communications.\n",

Aside from private consumption, India's GDP is also fueled by government spending, investments, and exports. As of 2025, India is the world's 7th-largest importer and the 10th-largest exporter. India is often described as the ‘pharmacy of the world’, supplying roughly 20% of the global demand for generic medicines and exporting pharmaceuticals to over 200 countries in 2023–24, with around 70% of exports to highly regulated markets like North America and Europe. India has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995. It ranks 40th on the Global Competitiveness Index. As of 2025, India ranks third in the world in total number of billionaires. According to the World Bank, India's Gini index fell to 25.5 in 2022‑23, making it the fourth-most equal country globally, suggesting significant progress in income equality. Economists and social scientists often consider India a welfare state. India's overall social welfare spending stood at 8.6% of GDP in 2021-22. With 607 million workers, the Indian labour force is the world's second-largest. India is among the countries with the longest working hours globally.

      "Summary: These are lists of Indian states and union territories by their nominal gross state domestic product (GSDP). GSDP is the sum of all value added by industries within each state or union territory and serves as a counterpart to the national gross domestic product (GDP). As of 2011, the Government accounted for about 21% of the GDP followed by agriculture with 21% and corporate sector at 12%. The remaining 48% is sourced from small proprietorship and partnership companies, unorganized sector and households.\n",

      "Summary: Nominal gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is the total value of a country's finished goods and services (gross domestic product) divided by its total population (per capita).\n",
      "Gross domestic product per capita is often used as a proxy indicator an indicator of a country's standard of living; however, this is inaccurate because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income and does not take into account social and environmental costs and benefits. Measures of personal income include average wage, real income, median income, disposable income and gross national income (GNI) per capita.\n",
      "Comparisons of GDP per capita are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n",
      "GDP per capita does not consider differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results may vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, while the standard of living of its population might not change by as much.\n",
      "Several leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions may be considered tax havens, and their GDP data subject to material distortion by tax-planning activities. Examples include Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland and Luxembourg.\n",
      "Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts (except Kosovo and Taiwan), but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. Four UN members (Cuba, Monaco and North Korea) do not belong to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), hence their economies are not ranked. Kosovo, is not a member of the United Nations and is a member of the IMF. Taiwan is not an IMF member, but it is listed in the official IMF indices.\n",

      "Summary: GDP (PPP) means gross domestic product based on purchasing power parity.  \n",
      "This article includes a list of countries by their forecast estimated GDP (PPP). Countries are sorted by GDP (PPP) forecast estimates from financial and statistical institutions that calculate using market or government official exchange rates. The data given on this page are based on the international dollar, a standardized unit used by economists. Certain regions that are not widely considered countries such as Hong Kong also show up in the list if they are distinct jurisdiction areas or economic entities.  \n",
      "GDP comparisons using PPP are arguably more useful than those using nominal GDP when assessing the domestic market of a state because PPP takes into account the relative cost of local goods, services and inflation rates of the country, rather than using international market exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in per capita income. For example, while the nominal GDP ranks of Germany and India are third and fourth re\u001b[0m\n",
      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe search results consistently state that India is the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP. However, none of the provided summaries explicitly state the numerical value of India's GDP in USD for 2023 or 2024. The information found focuses on rankings, economic sectors, and historical context. I need to find a source that directly states India's nominal GDP in USD for a recent year. I will try searching for \"India nominal GDP 2023 value\" to see if I can get a direct numerical answer.\n",
